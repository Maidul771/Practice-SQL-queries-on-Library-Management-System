## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to **practice SQL queries** using a Library Management System (LMS) database.  
It simulates the core operations of a library such as managing **branches, employees, members, books, issuing, and returning of books**.  

The main purpose is to provide a hands-on environment to learn and improve SQL skills including:
- Creating and managing tables
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Writing queries with **joins, subqueries, aggregate functions**
